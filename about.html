  <p><a href="index.html">Blankets for Boston</a> is a proposed winter activation activity, intended to be maintained by the Boston Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics. The primary goal of the project is to organize Blanket Building Events throughout the winter, to gather supplies for these events, to donate the blankets created during those events, and finally, to provide resources for blanket-making and donation outside of the events. We want to keep Boston warm all winter!</p>  
                  
                  <p>Blankets for Boston provides blankets to a variety of people in need by donating to several different charities, which are listed  <a href="resources.html">here</a>.</p>
                  
<p>The Blanket Building Events are intended to foster a sense of community throughout Boston. Each event will be hosted at a different public elementary school so that children and families all over the city can easily get involved. The events will be hosted on four Saturdays in December. Here are our <a href="events.html">proposed dates and locations.</a> </p>
                  
                  <p>Blankets and funds are for the project will be primarily provided by the Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics, but we'd also love to get help from generous people. If you wish to make a donation of blanket-making materials or money, please visit our <a href="donate.html">donations page.</a> In terms of material donations, we prefer fleece, which is approximately $6.00 per yard at <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&q=fabric+stores+in+boston&npsic=0&rflfq=1&rlha=0&rllag=42362530,-71074132,1634&tbm=lcl&ved=0ahUKEwiKzNXKxeHXAhWo54MKHdndDYYQjGoIaQ&tbs=lrf:!2m4!1e17!4m2!17m1!1e2!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:10&rldoc=1#rlfi=hd:;si:;mv:!1m3!1d65846.87892396569!2d-71.09422605!3d42.356000300000005!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i418!2i536!4f13.1;tbs:lrf:!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!2m4!1e17!4m2!17m1!1e2!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:10">local fabric stores</a>l. We also accept yarn and wool for crochet.</p>
                  <p>We want to make sure that our participants stay warm too. That's why, at a Blanket Making Event, you get to keep one blanket, and donate one blanket to charity.</p>
                  
                  <p>Our events do not assume any experience in making blankets. We provide instructions on how to make easy <a href="index.html#slides">No-Sew Blanket</a> on site. However, we provide many <a href="resources.html">resources</a> for more advanced or unique blankets.</p>
